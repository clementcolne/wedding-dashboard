# WeddingDashboard

This is an administrator dashboard which only displays the datas from the API of the project `clementcolne/wedding-webdite`. this project
is used to access the datas from the database to an easy way, and do not connect to the server of the website and visualize on PhpMyAdmin.

It's also a way for me to train my skills on Angular.

## Install & run
